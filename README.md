Instrustions for use: Press "START GAME" to start the game and then select the number of players from the options listed below the "SELECT PLAYERS" option.The game can be played by two to eight players represented in different colors. The
game is played on a board of 10 x 6. For each table cell, we define a critical mass. The
critical mass is equal to the number of orthogonal neighbors. 4 for regular cells, 3 for
border cells and 2 for corner cells. All cells are initially empty. The red and green
players take turns placing &quot;spheres&quot; of the corresponding color. A red player can only
place (red) balls in squares that are empty or already contain one or more red balls.
When two or more spheres are placed in the same cell, they stack. When a battery is
charged with a number of spheres equal to its critical mass, the battery explodes
immediately. As a result of the explosion, a sphere is added to each orthogonally
adjacent cell, and the initial cell loses as many spheres as its critical mass. Explosions
cause adjacent units to overload, and the chain reaction of explosions continues until
each unit is stable. When a red cell explodes and there are green cells around, the
green cells turn red, other explosion rules still follow. The same rules apply for the other
colors. The winner is the one who removes the orbs of all other players To increase chances of winning, a player must get the corners - getting the corners
offers the player an extraordinary chance to part whenever if the other player draws
near to it. Splitting with no different groups mass is of no utilization, you are simply
squandering your opportunity. If a player gets a three joint mass close to different
players mass, that player could get tricked and lose the game and the game is over.
